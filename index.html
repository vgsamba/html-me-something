    <p><strong>Rava / Sooji Upma</strong> is the most favourite south Indian breakfast. 
A huge number of variations of Upma are made with whole or refined ground wheat and rice of varied grain size, vermicelli or wheat semolina. A wide range of vegetables may be added, and may be garnished with a variety of beans (raw or sprouted), cashew and peanuts. For a variation called masala upma (known as ‘Kharabath’ in Karnataka), sambhar masala or garam masala is added along with red chilli powder, instead of green chillies.
